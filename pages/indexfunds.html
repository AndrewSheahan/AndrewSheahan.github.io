                        <h2>All the Background You Need</h2>
						<p>
                            Before we discuss index funds, it's important to understand two basic things - <span><b>stocks and mutual funds.</b></span>
                        </p>
                            <span><b><u>Stocks</u></b></span>
                        <p>
                            A stock is just a document that shows a partial ownership (or share) of a company. Because a lot of big companies are owned by more than one person, there needs to be a way to show who owns how much of the company. For example, Disney is a company that's worth billions of dollars, and is owned by literally millions of people. Some people have held onto their Disney stock for years, through ups and downs at the company, and some traders buy and sell stocks like Disney every day to try and make money while the price of ownership goes up and down. Here's the neat thing about stocks though - as an owner, you are participating in the wins and losses of the company. If you bought all of the stock in Disney, you would own it completely and all of the profits (or losses) in that company would be yours. If you bought 1% of the company's stock, you would share in 1% of its profits in good years, and 1% of it's losses in bad years. It's important to remember, they aren't just bits of paper (or 1s and 0s in a computer) - stocks are ACTUAL ownership in companies, and so you're paying a price to own some of that company. That's all you need to know about stocks for now. 
                        </p>
                        <span><b><u>Mutual funds</u></b></span>
                        <p>
                            A mutual fund is a pool of money from a bunch of investors that gets managed by the mutual fund managers. They charge a fee for their services, and invest your money (and the money for a lot of other people) in companies all over the world. In the United States alone, there were almost 10,000 mutual funds as of 2018. Now, here's the important bit, they're mutual because you mutually share the gains and losses with your fellow investors. And you mutually pay the fees. 
                        </p>
                           
                        </p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                            In the 1970s, a guy by the name of John (Jack) Bogle founded an investment group that would change the face of investing for millions of Americans. According to Warren Buffet - the most successful investor of our time, "Jack did more for American investors as a whole than any individual I've known." And what he did to build so much wealth for so many people like you and I was to invent the index fund. In his own words? "In investing, you get what you don't pay for."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                             What Bogle meant by that was, there are a lot of folks out there who want to 'help' you invest your hard earned money. For an apparently tiny fee, they would be willing to take your money and grow it for you over time, watching it "24/7 - we have people awake around the world at all hours of the day and night," as one invesment advisor told me. This might seem like an impressive idea, to have people prepared to pounce at a moment's notice and throw shields up around your money when conditions change, but what the hell was this guy planning to do with my money that he needed a SWAT team on call day and night!? 
                        </p>
                      <h2>What's an Index Fund?</h2>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An index fund is a collection of stocks that you can buy as a group. Like a lot of mutual funds, a company like Bogle's Vanguard Group puts it together buy buying a ton of stocks, bundling them together, and selling them on to individual investors.
