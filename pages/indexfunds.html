                        <h2>All the Background You Need</h2>
						<p>
                            Before we discuss index funds, it's important to understand two basic things - <span><b>stocks and mutual funds.</b></span>
                        </p>
                            <span><b><u>Stocks</u></b></span>
                        <p>
                            A stock is just a document that shows a partial ownership (or share) of a company. Because a lot of big companies are owned by more than one person, there needs to be a way to show who owns how much of the company. For example, Disney is a company that's worth billions of dollars, and is owned by literally millions of people. Some people have held onto their Disney stock for years, through ups and downs at the company, and some traders buy and sell stocks like Disney every day to try and make money while the price of ownership goes up and down. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here's the neat thing about stocks though - as an owner, you are participating in the wins and losses of the company. If you bought all of the stock in Disney, you would own it completely and all of the profits (or losses) in that company would be yours. If you bought 1% of the company's stock, you would share in 1% of its profits in good years, and 1% of it's losses in bad years. It's important to remember, they aren't just bits of paper (or 1s and 0s in a computer) - stocks are ACTUAL ownership in companies. You're paying a price to own some of that company because you think it will earn money for you. And that's really all you need to know about stocks for now. 
                        </p>
                        <span><b><u>Mutual funds</u></b></span>
                        <p>
                            A mutual fund is a just pool of money from a bunch of investors that has a manager. If you and your friends each put a thousand dollars together to buy some stocks, you'd basically have a mutual fund. The managers charge a fee for their services, and invest your money in companies all over the world. In the United States alone, there were almost 10,000 mutual funds as of 2018. Now, here's the important bit, they're mutual because you mutually share the gains and losses with your fellow investors. And you mutually <span><b>pay the fees.</b></span> 
                        <p>
                            Over the last tweny-ish years, mutual funds have received some very negative press, and for good reason. For decades, most of them have charged investors enormous fees that eat up huge portions of the profits and more often than not they've performed very badly. Some charge fees each time you buy more units of the fund. Some charge fees when you sell. And almost all of them charge you a percentage of your investment, each year, just to manage your money. <br><br><br><span> Remember this formula: <br><br><span><b>High Fees + Poor Performance = A Bad Deal</b></span></span><br><br>
                        </p>
                            Luckily, in the 1970s, a guy by the name of John (Jack) Bogle founded an investment group that would change the face of investing for millions. According to Warren Buffet - arguably the most successful investor of our time, "Jack did more for American investors as a whole than any individual I've known." And what he did to build so much wealth for so many people like you and I was to invent the index fund. In his own words? "In investing, you get what you don't pay for."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                             What Bogle meant by that was, there are a lot of folks out there who want to 'help' you invest your hard earned money. Most of them claim that, for a tiny fee, they would be willing to take your money and help you grow it. As one advisor told me at a presentation, "we have people awake, around the world, at all hours of the day and night to watch your money and make sure it's well taken care of." This might seem like an impressive statement, to have people prepared to pounce at a moment's notice and throw shields up around your money when conditions change, but what the hell was this guy planning to do with my money that he needed a SWAT team on call day and night!? And who was paying these people? And hell, who was paying for the beautiful office building we were in? It turns out, it was those <span><i>tiny</i></span> fees. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bogle had a theory, and it went something like this: if the average performance of the whole stock market is actually pretty good and reliable over the long term, why not just shoot for an "average" return? Studying his competitors,

                      <h2>What's an Index Fund?</h2>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An index fund is a collection of stocks that you can buy as a group. Like a lot of mutual funds, a company like Bogle's Vanguard Group puts it together buy buying a ton of stocks, bundling them together, and selling them on to individual investors.
