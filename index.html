	<section class="writing">
			There's a question that Warren Buffet often asks his audiences that drills down to the essence of a Lucky Canuck: if you could go back to the time before you were born and choose to come into the world as a different person, would you do it? You can't pick who you're going to be. You don't get to decide if you're going to be born male or female, rich or poor, healthy or sick, slow or smart, in Calgary of Karachi - you get what you get and there's no going back.<br><br>

			A Lucky Canuck is just someone who says "no thanks." They recognize that they've got it good, and wouldn't gamble it all away for nothing. 
			<br><br>

			Generally, if you're healthy, received a decent education, have a job that pays the bills and leaves you with some money leftover at the end of the month, YOU are a Lucky Canuck. (You don't even have to be Canadain to qualify!)
