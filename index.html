							"I want to learn to invest my money and build Financial Independence (Fi). I don't want to go to work because I <span><i>have</i></span> to, I want the freedom to choose the work I <span><i>want</i></span> to do. With all of the information out there, I just don't know where to start to make that happen."

							Well, I've always enjoyed learning about investing and I often get asked if there is an easy way to start. Rather than give a mini-presentation each time, I figured I'd just build a simple little website. This is all based on my personal <span>how I got started on the path to financial freedom</span> story, and I hope it provides you with a simple path to get you going, right from square one.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'll start with a little bit of background to help build the overall picture - and I'll make it as quick and painless as possible. You don't have to read it all in one shot, but if you can get through the next three little pages, you'll be well on your way.

							After that, I'll talk about some basic rules that I think are important, and then I'll get more into the specific options you have when it comes to putting your hard-earned dollars to work. Along the way, I'll tell you about some of my owne experiences, like when I forgot some of the basic rules and made investing exciting - the very BAD kind of exciting. Overall, I just want to give you a look at
