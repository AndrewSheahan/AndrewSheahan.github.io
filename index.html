	<section><br>

			There are a lot of ways to invest - but it's probably best that we start with the simplest possible view: you want to own things that make me money. The longer you can own those things, and the more money they make for you, the better. And it's really that simple. <br><br>
			
			Now, if it's as simple as that, why does everyone make it so complicated? 
			The simple answer is that the sales people who make a living investing your money (the bankers, advisors, and wealth managers) want to take a cut - a big cut. That's how they feed themselves, buy their fancy cars, and pay for their expensive suits. 
			The office that they invite you into - it's nice isn't it? It's also not cheap, and if you invest with them, you're helping to pay for it. <br><br>
			
			
			Picture a tree with 100 little leaves on it. If you knew 1 year from now, each one of those leaves would be worth a dollar, how much would you pay for that tree? 
			
			You might say, well, it's 100$ of leaves, so I'd be willing to pay up to 100$. That's good - we've put our first value on the tree. <br><br>
			
			But what if now you have to care for that tree? 
			<br><br>
			What if you have to water it and prune away the dead branches and protect it from leaf eating caterpillars? Now it's turning into a lot of work. Maybe now it's only worth 90$ to us. 
			
			Now that we're thinking about it, what if there are a few trees to choose from? Tree one has 100$ of leaves that should be mature in 6 months, but requires a fair amount of work. Tree two, just down the aisle has 120$ worth of leaves that will be ready in 1 year. It requires even more work, but there are more leaves
			and it's been marked down to 80$! It's starting to look pretty appealing but you see a really boring, small tree down the way and ask the sales man what the story is with that tree -er... shrub?
			
			Oh, that tree? You don't want that tree - it's really boring to look at, focus on tree 1 and 2 he tells you. </section>
