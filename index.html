						<h2>Does this sound like you?</h2>
						<p>
"I want to learn to invest my money and build <span>Financial Independence (Fi).</span> I don't want to go to work because I have to pay the bills, I want the freedom to choose my work. With all of the information out there, I just don't know where to start to make that happen."
						</p>
						<p>
Well, I've always enjoyed learning about investing and I often get asked if there is an easy way to start. Rather than give a mini-presentation each time, I figured I'd just build a simple little website. This is my personal <span>how I got started on the path to financial freedom</span> story, and I hope it provides you with a simple path to get you going, right from square one.

I'll start with day one, when I was first introduced to the concept of sensible, boring investing by a friend - thanks Kristjan! I'll tell you about when I forgot some of those basic rules and made investing exciting - the very BAD kind of exciting. And I'll talk about how I bought my first stock, the different ways you can do that, and the freedom that comes with building a good balance sheet - what the hell is a balance sheet?!
