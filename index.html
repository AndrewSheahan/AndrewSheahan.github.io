	<h2 style="color:darkolivegreen;">"Time in the market is better than timing the market."</h2>
	<p>Global markets appear to be melting down yet again and investors are preparing to relive the 'horrors' of 2008/2009. How can anyone possibly find their way through the chaos? Is there any possible investment strategy that will survive the panic and fear running rampant through the media? <br> <br>
	
	<p>The COVID-19 outbreak has nearly everyone uneasy about the future of the stockmarkets (not to mention healthcare) and perhaps rightfully so. Shouldn't we have seen this coming? SARS and Ebola both scared us, but maybe not enough? </p>

	<p>The good news is that, despite the brutal news everyday, when we do come out of this, we will be better prepared for future pandemics. And on top of that, with a few good decisions now, you can also be better prepared for any number of life emergencies. How?</p>
